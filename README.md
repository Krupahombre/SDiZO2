*Branch 'refactoring' is for manual testing*

Project that implements graph algorithms for Minimum Spanning Tree and Shortest Path.
I used adjacency list and incidence matrix as representations of graphs in memory.

Algorithms for MST
* Prim algorithm
* Kruskal algorithm

Algorithms for Shortest Path
* Dijkstra algorithm
* Bellman-Ford algorithm
